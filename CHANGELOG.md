## [Unreleased]

### Added

- No unreleased entries yet.

## [3.0.1]

### Added

- Initial OSS package split for protobuf request and response support on top of `InnoNetwork`
- `ProtobufAPIDefinition`, `ProtobufNetworkClient`, `ProtobufEmptyResponse`, and `HTTPEmptyResponseMessage`
- Docs / contract sync automation, protobuf doc smoke target, and consumer smoke validation
- OSS governance documents, release policy, migration policy, support policy, and issue / PR templates

### Changed

- Protobuf support now lives outside the core `InnoNetwork` package so consumers that do not need protobuf no longer resolve `swift-protobuf`
- Core dependency is pinned to `InnoNetwork` `3.0.1` for the initial public release
